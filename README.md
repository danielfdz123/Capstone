## Development Workflow

1. **Branching strategy**: use `dev` for integration, feature branches `feat/xxx` for new work.
2. **Pull requests**: Open PRs against `dev`. Require at least one review and passing CI.
3. **Lint & format**: ESLint + Prettier (frontend), ESLint or other linter for backend.
4. **Commit messages**: Use concise, imperative tense (e.g., "Add login endpoint").
